Let's get started...you have to click on the box which will show you a picture and your job is to find its matching pair.You can click on 2 boxes at a time, if they match the boxes will turn green , if they don't they will flip and the picture will disappear.

So start the game and click on the boxes till you find a matching pair. The game also has a timer to record your time in finding all the matching pairs. It also awards you with stars and counts the number of moves you made to find all matching pairs. 2 clicks is counted as a single move.

Once all the pairs are matched , a popup will appear to tell you your score. It will have the time, stars and the moves you made during the game. You can restart the game by clicking on replay button on the popup or by clicking on restart icon on the page. Refreshing the page will also reload the game and you will loose your progress .
All the best! Enjoy the game.
